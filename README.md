# Individual Self Assessment

## Self Assessment

It was diifficult to make this project but together as a team we were successfully be able to complete this project. It was greatful to be the part of my team. I was mainly responsible for the presentation slides and creating the dashboard. Daniel was great in helping each one of us and ensured to finish our tasks on time. This Bootcamp has given me somewhat of a foundation to continously build from. There are things I could have done better but overall gave it my best with the time that was given to me. Fortunately I can continue to run through these Modules to continue to understand the applications. I entered this Bootcamp expierence with wanting to add additional tools and skills to my resume, which I believe this program has provided.
